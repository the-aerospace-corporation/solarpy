Welcome to solarpy's documentation!
===================================
solarpy is a library that encompasses various tools to understand, analyze, and process solar cells.  The solarpy library primarily focuses on evaluating space solar cells.  Tools such as the California Institute of Technology Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Equivalent Flux (JPL EQFLUX) and Naval Research Laboratory's Displacement Damage Dose (NRL DDD) method are incorporated into the library.  The equations and methods used are primarily from the JPL Solar Cell and GaAs Solar Cell Radiation Handbooks as well as SCREAM (the NRL implementation of DDD).  In the future tools will be added that analyze light current-voltage, dark current-voltage, quantum efficiency, electroluminescence, etc.
